# Robot Fight

Today we'll be modelling a game which will allow a bunch of robots to fight each other

## Requirements

- Each robot should be given a turn to attack
- Any number of robots should be allowed to participate
- Each robot will do a random amount of damage from 1 to it's attack power (AP)
- Each robot has a health stat which starts at 50 points (HP)
- If a robot goes below 20% health, it goes berserk dealing double damage.
